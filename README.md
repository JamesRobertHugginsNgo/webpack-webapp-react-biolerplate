- Babel
- TypeScript
- Sass
- React
- Optional Frontend Libraries

## EditorConfig

This uses [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) to help maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs.

When used with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), the [EditorConfig for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) extension may be needed.

## ESLint

This uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to find and fix problems in JavaScript and TypeScript codes.

When used with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), the [VS Code ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) may be needed.

## WebPack

This uses [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org) to bundle code and assets.

This is configured to allow custom cframes wrappers, creates code that is viewable with or without an HTTP server, as well as using relative path or a configurable absolute path.

## Babel

This uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io) JavaScript transpiler to allow the use of the latest JavaScript.

## TypeScript

This includes the TypeScript transpiler to allow the use of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.

TypeScript files must have a .ts or .tsx file extension to be transpiled.

## Sass

This includes the Sass transpiler to allow the use of [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), CSS with superpower.

Sass files must have a .sass or .scss file extension to be transpiled.

## React

This includes [React](https://react.dev) JavaScript library for building user interfaces and allows the use of JSX elements on JavaScript code.

JSX elements can only be used on JavaScript codes with a .jsx file extension and on Typescript codes with a .tsx file extension.
